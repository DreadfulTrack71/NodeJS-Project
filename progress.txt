Made first http server from Node.JS!
The message display is from a fixed string. Try having it read from a file instead.

Add a second URL that can be used to gracefully shutdown the server, rather than
hitting ctrl+c at the command prompt

Successfuilly read from file!
Added code to display text based on url with q= syntax. The server crashes when that code is executed more than once. Fix that crash.
Use that syntax to add code to shutdown the server.
